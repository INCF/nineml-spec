  b. maintain and update the specifications of the NineML language, this includes considering proposals for expanding the   specifications  
  c. interact with other organizations that are interested in model description languages  
    [Note: 1b is the primary task of this committee, in the future 1a or 1c may be taken over by other NineML committees]

1. The committee has a chair who is elected for two years by a simple majority of its active members. The chair can be replaced if a majority of active members decides so. The chair makes sure that the committee performs its tasks in an orderly manner and is responsible for calling meetings and organizing a vote. The chair is also the official contact person for the committee.
1. The committee tries to achieve consensus for its decisions. In case no consensus can be reached a vote will be taken.

1. Most committee business, including voting, is conducted using electronic communication. Members are expected to respond within one week to e-mails unless they announced a prolonged absence. In the case of voting a lack of response within two weeks is considered an abstain. The records of the electronic communication are the minutes of the committee.
