Network Interchange for NEuroscience (NineML) is a simulator-independent language with the aim of providing an unambiguous description of neuronal network models for efficient model sharing and reusability.

NineML emerged from a joint effort of experts in the fields of computational neuroscience, simulator development and simulator-independent language initiatives ([NeuroML](http://www.neuroml.org/), [PyNN](http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/)), grouped in the [INCF Multiscale Modeling Task Force](https://www.incf.org/activities/our-programs/modeling/people). This effort was initiated and is still supported by the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)](http://www.incf.org), as part of the standardization effort of the [Multiscale Modeling Program](https://www.incf.org/activities/our-programs/modeling), but the project is now run as a [community project](../committee).
