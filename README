This repository contains code related to the 9ML language being developed by the
INCF Task Force for a Standard Language in Neural Network Modeling
(http://www.incf.org/core/programs/modeling).

The repository is structured as follows:

- catalog:    contains abstraction layer definition files
- converters: contains tools for converting abstraction layer files to other formats
- lib9ml:     contains code for reading, writing and generally working with 9ML
              abstraction- and user-layer files.
