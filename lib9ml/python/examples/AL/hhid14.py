# The Isyn was generated statistically in this paper.
#
# 1. The spike volleys had intervals normally distributed with mean P
# 2. Spike-time probability was the convolution of a Gaussian filter with the volley-time 
# 3. Spike-times were generated as a Poisson process from the probability calculated in step 2.
# 4. Each input spike caused an exponentially decaying inhibitory conductance.
#
# TODO: how do we combine the above four into a state transition based
# system? What should be the components?
# I can think of NormalRNG -> GaussianFilter -> PoissonGenerator -> SpikeGenerator
#
# 1. Remove all volley intervals from buffer P[i-n], P[i-n+1], ..., P[i-j] where
#    sum(P[i-1] ... P[i-j] > 20 ms.
#    Generate a random sample P[i] from normal distribution with mean P and
#    coefficient of variation Cv. Generate P[i+1], P[i+2], P[i+n] until their
#    sum exceeds 20 ms (> 2 * SD of the Gaussian filter).
#
# 2. Calculate the "spike-time-probability" (STP) at current time t by convolving the Gaussian filter
#    SD = sigma and area = a * dt for all P[i] in buffer, where dt is the integration
#    timestep.
#
# 3. When it comes to computing the spikes, the paper is confusing. It says that
#    "input spike times were generated as a Poisson process from STP, as in [74]."
#    But ref [74] (Tiesinga, Fellous, Jos and Sejnowski, 2002. Network: Comput. Neural Syst. 13 (2002) 41–66))
#    does not even mention Poisson process, but computes firing probability by summing the firing rate over 1 s.
#    I am not clear if that resolves to a Poisson process. If we take STP to be the rate of
#    a homogeneous Poisson process, lambda, then the probability of a spike within the timestep t
#    to t+dt is STP * dt.
#  
# 4. The synaptic conductance is exponentially decaying and can be easily implemented.
