Abstraction layer tutorial
==========================

Note that at present the Python API for the abstraction layer only supports
neuron and synapse models.

Here we will use the Izhikevich neuron model as an example.

Start by importing the abstraction layer module::
    
    >>> import nineml.abstraction_layer as nineml

A neuron model in NineML consists of a number of "regimes" (which may be
nested) connected by "transitions". Regimes may contain equations and other
regimes, and may be of two sorts, "unions", whose elements may be evaluated in
parallel (if in series, the order of evaluation does not matter), and "sequences",
where the elements must be evaluated in order (generally because the outputs of
one element feed into the inputs of the next).

For the Izhikevich model, we need to define two regimes: subthreshold and post-spike::

    >>> subthreshold_regime = nineml.Union(
    ...                         "dV/dt = 0.04*V*V + 5*V + 140.0 - U + Isyn",
    ...                         "dU/dt = a*(b*V - U)",
    ...                         name="subthreshold_regime")

    >>> post_spike_regime = nineml.Union(
    ...                         "V = c",
    ...                         "U += d",
    ...                         name="post_spike_regime")

The syntax for writing equations (which may be either ordinary differential
equations or assignments) is basically the same as Python's expression syntax
(and very similar to that of C, etc.), except for the ``dV/dt`` part.

When the membrane potential passes a threshold, the neuron transitions from the
sub-threshold regime to the post-spike regime::
    
    >>> spike_transition = nineml.Transition(
    ...                         from_=subthreshold_regime,
    ...                         to=post_spike_regime,
    ...                         condition="V > theta",
    ...                         name="spike_transition")

and then it automatically transitions back (``condition=None``)::

    >>> return_transition = nineml.Transition(
    ...                         from_=post_spike_regime,
    ...                         to=subthreshold_regime,
    ...                         condition=None,
    ...                         name="return_transition")

To create the neuron component, we need to specify a name, the parameters, and
a list of transitions::
    
    >>> parameters = ["Isyn", "a", "b", "c", "d", "theta"]
    >>> c = nineml.Component("Izhikevich", parameters,
    ...                      transitions=(spike_transition, return_transition))
    
The parameters are not strictly necessary, as they can be inferred, but serve
for cross-checking that the model reflects the modeller's intent.

Now we can export the component as XML (normally to a file, but here we print
it to the screen)::

    >>> import sys
    >>> c.write(sys.stdout)
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
    <nineml xmlns="http://nineml.org/9ML/0.1">
      <component name="Izhikevich">
        <parameter name="Isyn"/>
        <parameter name="a"/>
        <parameter name="b"/>
        <parameter name="c"/>
        <parameter name="d"/>
        <parameter name="theta"/>
        <union name="post_spike_regime">
          <assignment to="V" name="Assignment0">
            <math-inline>c</math-inline>
          </assignment>
          <inplace to="U" name="InplaceAdd0" op="+=">
            <math-inline>d</math-inline>
          </inplace>
        </union>
        <union name="subthreshold_regime">
          <ode independent_variable="t" name="ODE0" dependent_variable="V">
            <math-inline>0.04*V*V + 5*V + 140.0 - U + Isyn</math-inline>
          </ode>
          <ode independent_variable="t" name="ODE1" dependent_variable="U">
            <math-inline>a*(b*V - U)</math-inline>
          </ode>
        </union>
        <transition to="post_spike_regime" from="subthreshold_regime" name="spike_transition" condition="V &gt; theta">
          <assignment to="tspike" name="Assignment1">
            <math-inline>t</math-inline>
          </assignment>
        </transition>
        <transition to="subthreshold_regime" from="post_spike_regime" name="return_transition" condition="true"/>
      </component>
    </nineml>
    
Note that there is no specification yet for an XML representation of the
abstraction layer, so the syntax above will almost certainly change in future.
If the model is expressed in Python, however, it will be easy to export new XML
files every time the syntax changes. Also note that for now we are using a
simple "inline" maths syntax, but (optional?) use of MathML is planned.


Reading abstraction layer Components from file
----------------------------------------------

Now let's write our Izhikevich component to a file::

    >>> c.write("test.xml")

and then read it back in and check it is indeed the same component::

    >>> c1 = nineml.parse("test.xml")
    >>> c == c1
    True
    

Exploring an abstraction layer Component
----------------------------------------

Once you have a NineML ``Component`` object, it can be introspected in various
ways. To get a list of the various methods and attributes of the component
object, use the Python ``help()`` function::

    >>> help(c)
    Help on Component in module nineml.abstraction_layer object:
    .
    .
    .
    
We can also inspect the ``Component`` at various levels of detail::

    >>> c.regimes
    set([Union(post_spike_regime), Union(subthreshold_regime)])
    
    >>> c.transitions
    set([Transition(from Union(subthreshold_regime) to Union(post_spike_regime) if V > theta),
         Transition(from Union(post_spike_regime) to Union(subthreshold_regime) if true)])
    >>> list(c.equations)
    [Assignment('V', 'c'),
     Inplace('U', '+=', 'd'),
     Assignment('tspike', 't'),
     ODE(dV/dt = 0.04*V*V + 5*V + 140.0 - U + Isyn),
     ODE(dU/dt = a*(b*V - U))]
    >>> c.variables
    set(['U', 't', 'V'])
    >>> c.independent_variables
    set(['t'])
    >>> c.integrated_variables
    set(['U', 'V'])
    >>> c.parameters
    ['Isyn', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'theta']
    
To visualize the component, we can export it in dot format (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language)::

    >>> c.to_dot("test.dot")
    
Various tools can convert a dot file to an image, for example GraphViz (http://graphviz.org/).
If you have GraphViz installed, then on the command-line you can convert the dot
files into various image formats, e.g.::

    $ dot -Tsvg test.dot -o test.svg
    $ dot -Tpng test.dot -o test.png


Regimes also have various useful methods and attributes, e.g.::

    >>> subthresh = c.regime_map['subthreshold_regime']
    >>> help(subthresh)
    Help on Union in module nineml.abstraction_layer object:
    .
    .
    .
    >>> list(subthresh.equations)
    [ODE(dV/dt = 0.04*V*V + 5*V + 140.0 - U + Isyn), ODE(dU/dt = a*(b*V - U))]
    >>> list(subthresh.odes())
    [ODE(dV/dt = 0.04*V*V + 5*V + 140.0 - U + Isyn), ODE(dU/dt = a*(b*V - U))]
    >>> 
    >>> list(subthresh.neighbors)
    [Union(post_spike_regime)]
    >>> subthresh.transitions
    set([Transition(from Union(subthreshold_regime) to Union(post_spike_regime) if V > theta)])
    
as do equations::

    >>> dv, du = subthresh.equations
    >>> print dv
    ODE(dV/dt = 0.04*V*V + 5*V + 140.0 - U + Isyn)
    >>> dv.indep_variable
    't'
    >>> dv.dependent_variable
    'V'
    >>> dv.rhs
    '0.04*V*V + 5*V + 140.0 - U + Isyn'
    >>> dv.as_expr()
    'dV/dt = 0.04*V*V + 5*V + 140.0 - U + Isyn'
    >>> from lxml.etree import tostring
    >>> print tostring(dv.to_xml(), pretty_print=True)
    <ode independent_variable="t" name="ODE0" dependent_variable="V">
      <math-inline>0.04*V*V + 5*V + 140.0 - U + Isyn</math-inline>
    </ode>
