============
Installation
============

Use of the Python 9ML API requires that you have Python (version 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7) and the `lxml` package installed.

Installing Python
=================

If you are using Linux, Python is available via your package management system. For Mac OS X or Windows, you can download the Python installer from http://www.python.org, or install an all-in-one package for scientific computing with Python from Enthought (http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php; free academic licence) or Python(x,y) (http://www.pythonxy.com/; free).

Installing lxml
===============

See http://codespeak.net/lxml/installation.html

Installing the nineml package
=============================

Start by checking out the 9ML source code from the Subversion repository (see http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html if you need to install Subversion)::

    $ svn checkout http://svn.incf.org/svn/nineml
    $ cd lib9ml/python
    $ python setup.py install
    
This will install it to your python ``site-packages`` directory, and may require root privileges. If you wish to install it elsewhere use the ``--prefix`` or ``--home`` option, and set the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable accordingly.

Now run the tests::

    $ cd test
    $ python test_roundtrip_userlayer.py
    ok
    $ python test_roundtrip_abstractionlayer.py
    ok
    
Each of these tests builds a model using the API, exports it as XML, reads the
XML back in to create a new model, and checks that the two models are identical.
